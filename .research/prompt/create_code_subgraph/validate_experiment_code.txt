Input:
You are an AI code reviewer validating production-ready experiment code for research papers.

Analyze the provided experiment code and determine if it meets all requirements for immediate execution in research experiments.

# Instructions

## Core Validation Criteria
Check if the generated experiment code meets ALL of the following requirements:

1. **Complete Implementation**:
   - Every component is fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code
   - No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
   - All functions and classes are completely implemented
   - No truncated code sections or incomplete implementations

2. **Hydra Integration**:
   - Uses Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/runs/*.yaml` files
   - All parameters are loaded from run configs dynamically
   - Proper configuration structure with run_id, method, model, dataset, training, and optuna sections
   - CLI interface matches:
     * Training (full): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full`
     * Training (trial): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial`
     * Evaluation: `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'` (independent execution)
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

3. **Complete Data Pipeline**:
   - Full data loading and preprocessing implementation
   - Dataset-specific preprocessing is properly implemented
   - No placeholder dataset loading code
   - Proper error handling for data operations
   - Uses `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models

4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Complete model architectures for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)
   - No placeholders (TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or incomplete implementations)
   - When External Resources specify HuggingFace models: properly use and customize them (acceptable to wrap AutoModel, add adapters, etc.)
   - When no external models specified: implement architectures from scratch using PyTorch primitives
   - Model-specific configurations correctly applied
   - Proper PyTorch usage throughout

5. **File Structure Compliance**:
   - Contains EXACTLY these required files (and NO other files):
     * `src/train.py`
     * `src/evaluate.py`
     * `src/preprocess.py`
     * `src/model.py`
     * `src/main.py`
     * `pyproject.toml`
     * `config/config.yaml`
   - NO additional files (e.g., NO `src/__init__.py`, NO `setup.py`, NO other Python files)
   - No missing files from the structure
   - All functionality contained within specified files

6. **WandB Integration**:
   - train.py initializes WandB and logs ALL metrics comprehensively:
     * Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant time-series metrics
     * Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture complete training dynamics
     * Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` to save final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, best_epoch, etc.)
     * Metric names in train.py's wandb.log() MUST exactly match the keys used in evaluate.py's run.history()
   - Optuna Integration: If using Optuna, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only log the final run with best hyperparameters
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"` before any WandB operations
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` before any WandB operations
   - NO results.json or stdout JSON dumps in train.py
   - config/config.yaml contains mandatory WandB settings (entity/project)
   - `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is available for authentication

7. **Configuration Files**:
   - The generated code properly references config files via Hydra
   - NOTE: config/runs/{run_id}.yaml files are provided separately (not in ExperimentCode)
   - All run configurations match the experiment_runs provided
   - Optuna search spaces are properly defined if applicable

8. **Evaluation Script Independence**:
   - evaluate.py is executed independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
   - Accepts `run_ids` parameter as JSON string list (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
   - main.py DOES NOT call evaluate.py
   - evaluate.py loads WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
   - evaluate.py retrieves comprehensive data from WandB API:
     * Use `wandb.Api()` to get run data: `run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")`
     * Retrieve: `history = run.history()`, `summary = run.summary._json_dict`, `config = dict(run.config)`
   - **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
     * Export comprehensive run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
     * Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
     * Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
   - **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
     * Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json` with the following structure:
       ```json
       {
         "primary_metric": "Exact-match accuracy at 30 min wall-clock.",
         "metrics": {
           "metric_name_1": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...},
           "metric_name_2": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...}
         },
         "best_proposed": {
           "run_id": "proposed-iter2-model-dataset",
           "value": 0.92
         },
         "best_baseline": {
           "run_id": "comparative-1-model-dataset",
           "value": 0.88
         },
         "gap": 4.55
       }
       ```
       The structure must include:
       - "primary_metric": The primary evaluation metric name from the hypothesis
       - "metrics": All collected metrics organized by metric name, then by run_id
       - "best_proposed": The run_id and value of the proposed method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "proposed")
       - "best_baseline": The run_id and value of the baseline/comparative method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "comparative" or "baseline")
       - "gap": Performance gap calculated as: (best_proposed.value - best_baseline.value) / best_baseline.value * 100
         * Must use the expected results from the hypothesis to determine metric direction (higher vs lower is better)
         * If the metric should be minimized, reverse the sign of the gap
         * The gap represents the percentage improvement of the proposed method over the best baseline
     * Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`
     * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
     * Performance metrics tables
     * Statistical significance tests
   - Proper figure quality: legends, annotations, tight_layout
   - Follows GLOBALLY UNIQUE naming convention to prevent collisions:
     * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
     * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
   - train.py and main.py generate NO figures
   - evaluate.py cannot run in trial_mode (no WandB data available when WandB disabled)

9. **Mode-Based Implementation**:
   - `mode` parameter controls experiment behavior (required parameter)
   - When `cfg.mode == "trial"`:
     * Properly reduces computational load: epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, Optuna disabled (n_trials=0), small evaluation subset
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`
     * Purpose: Fast validation that code runs without errors
   - When `cfg.mode == "full"`:
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`
     * Uses full configuration (full epochs, full Optuna trials, etc.)

## Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- `is_code_ready`: boolean - true if ALL criteria are met, false otherwise
- `code_issue`: string - specific issues found if any criteria are not met, focusing on what needs to be fixed

# Hypothesis
open_problems='1.  Current LR schedulers for PEFT treat every training step in isolation.  However, GSM8K fine-tuning lasts only ≈2 000 optimiser steps, so step–to–step LR correlations dominate final accuracy.  No method explicitly *models* these correlations or re-uses experience collected on earlier budgets.\n2.  Token-level difficulty is visible before the backward pass through inexpensive forward-only probes (e.g. logit entropy after the **first** adapter layer).  Existing token-aware tuners (BATS) wait until the full backward pass finishes, missing a chance to scale the *next* gradient.\n3.  Compute budgets in practice are often set *per experiment* (e.g. “one hour on one A100”), not per step.  Scheduling should optimise the *entire training trajectory* under a user-supplied wall-clock budget B without the need for k-step roll-outs or quadratic programming.\n4.  Even the best RL-based controller (REACTOR) needs policy-gradient updates with high-variance rewards and hand-picked baselines; this slows convergence and couples the tuner’s learning rate to the very problem it tries to solve.' method='We propose GRAFF (Graph-Recurrent  Allocation  of  Fine-tuning  Funds) – a budget-aware, differentiable LR planner that learns an *entire trajectory* in closed form using one extra forward pass per mini-batch.\n\nA.

# Current Research Method
We propose GRAFF (Graph-Recurrent  Allocation  of  Fine-tuning  Funds) – a budget-aware, differentiable LR planner that learns an *entire trajectory* in closed form using one extra forward pass per mini-batch.

A.  Budget-conditioned trajectory encoder
   • Maintain a latent state h_t updated by a lightweight Graph Neural Net whose nodes are adapter blocks and whose edge features are instantaneous curvature Δλᵢ and entropy Hᵢ after the *first* adapter layer.  This runs in the same forward pass as the loss – no HVPs.
   • Remaining budget b_t = B – time_so_far is appended to every node feature, letting the network reason about *global* constraints.

B.  Closed-form LR decoder
   • Decoder is a single linear map W applied to h_t that outputs log η_t and token multipliers m_{t,i}.  Because W is linear, gradients wrt W are available from the normal back-prop of the loss; no REINFORCE needed.
   • To prevent instability we project W after every update onto the half-space defined by η_t·λ̂_max≤1.9 (edge-of-stability guard).

C.  Self-supervised training objective
   • We derive the *compute-normalised regret* R_T = (ℒ_T – ℒ_best)/time_T where ℒ_T is running avg loss.  Its gradient wrt W is tractable because both numerator and denominator depend smoothly on W through η_t.
   • We optimise W with Adam (lr 1e-3) concurrently with model weights: two optimisers, one backward.

D.  Zero-shot transfer & warm start
   • Pre-train W for 300 steps on GSM8K with tiny (70 M) Qwen-tiny; store weights.  When fine-tuning a new model we warm-start W and keep “outer” optimiser active –  no policy search from scratch.

Implementation is <160 LoC PyTorch; adds one Jacobian-vector product (auto-diff) per step (≈2 % run-time).

# Experimental Design
- Strategy: This experiment evaluates GRAFF—our new, differentiable, budget-aware learning-rate (LR) planner—against a strong token-aware RL baseline (REACTOR) when LoRA-fine-tuning a 0.6-billion-parameter Qwen3 model on the GSM8K mathematics dataset.  

Workflow
1. Data loading: GSM8K train/dev is streamed with length-bucketing (batch_size = 64) and mixed-precision (bfloat16).  
2. Model: Qwen3-0.6B is equipped with LoRA adapters (rank = 64, α = 16) on all self-attention and MLP layers; only adapter weights are trainable.  
3. GRAFF module: each mini-batch’s forward pass collects two cheap probes per adapter block—logit entropy after the first adapter layer and Hessian-free curvature estimate Δλᵢ.  Node features = [Δλᵢ, Hᵢ, remaining_budget].  A 2-layer message-passing GNN updates the latent state h_t, after which a single linear decoder W outputs (a) global LR η_t for the optimiser and (b) per-token multipliers m_{t,i}.  W is projected after every update to satisfy η_t·λ̂_max ≤ 1.9.  
4. Joint optimisation: the normal model loss plus the compute-normalised regret R_T is back-propagated once; Adam (lr = 2e-4) updates adapter weights while a second Adam (lr = 1e-3) updates W.  
5. Budget tracking: wall-clock time is monitored with CUDA events; once 30-min or 60-min budgets are exhausted, training halts and dev exact-match (EM) is recorded.  
6. Baseline: REACTOR replaces GRAFF but keeps all other settings identical.  
7. Hyper-parameter search over three key knobs (see below) is done with 50 trials of Optuna using the 30-min EM as the objective.  
8. Metrics collected: dev EM @30 min (primary), dev EM @60 min, AUC(EM-vs-time)/B, and energy (Joules) read every 5 s from nvidia-smi.  
The entire pipeline fits comfortably into an 80 GB A100 (peak ≈34 GB) and <10 GB system RAM per worker; RAM-heavy dataloading is disabled by streaming.
- Proposed Method: GRAFF (Graph-Recurrent Allocation of Fine-tuning Funds) is a learning-rate scheduler that plans an entire training trajectory in closed form while respecting a user-supplied wall-clock budget B.

Key components
1. Budget-conditioned encoder: Each adapter block is a node in a lightweight graph neural network.  Node features include instantaneous curvature (Δλᵢ) estimated via a single Hessian-vector product, token-level entropy (Hᵢ) after the first adapter layer, and the remaining budget b_t = B – time_so_far.  One message-passing step updates latent states h_t.
2. Linear decoder: A single weight matrix W maps the mean of h_t to log η_t (global LR) and each h_t to token multipliers m_{t,i}.  Because the decoder is linear, gradients wrt W flow through the normal loss; no REINFORCE or separate controller optimisation is needed.
3. Stability guard: After every optimiser step, W is projected so that η_t·λ̂_max ≤ 1.9, keeping updates near the edge of stability.
4. Objective: Compute-normalised regret R_T = (ℒ_T – ℒ_best)/time_T is differentiable in W through η_t, allowing simultaneous optimisation of adapter weights and scheduler parameters with standard back-prop.
5. Warm-start: W is pre-trained for 300 mini-batches on a 70 M-parameter Qwen-tiny model; the same W is then continuously fine-tuned online when larger models are trained, enabling zero-shot transfer across sizes.

Algorithmic procedure per mini-batch
(1) Forward pass through model and probes → collect Δλᵢ, Hᵢ.
(2) GNN update → h_t.
(3) Decode (η_t, m_{t,i}); scale optimiser LR and token gradients.
(4) Backward pass; accumulate gradients of both adapter weights and W.
(5) Adam steps for both parameter sets; project W; log time & energy.

{
    "is_code_ready": false,
    "code_issue": "The package cannot run in its current state – several critical defects violate the validation rules:\n\n1. Wrong access to the run id (breaks every training run)\n   • _wandb_init() does  id=cfg.run.run_id  although cfg.run is a string that is passed from CLI (e.g. \"proposed-iter1-…\").  Attribute access raises AttributeError before any training starts.\n\n2. Optuna integration is non-functional\n   • _objective() updates cfg via OmegaConf.update(cfg, hp_name.replace(\"_\", \".\"), …) which produces paths such as \"adapter.lr.init\" that never influence the actual training hyper-parameters (should be training.optimizer.lr_init, etc.).\n   • _objective returns float(OmegaConf.to_container(cfg).get(\"final_dev_em\", 0.0)) but _train_single_run never writes this key, so every trial returns 0.0 – search is useless.\n\n3. results_dir is ignored in train.py; no checkpoints/artefacts are saved there.  Requirement 3 demands proper error-free data handling for all file operations.\n\n4. gradient_accumulation_steps from the config is never honoured – the effective global batch size is wrong, deviating from the published configuration.\n\n5. Scheduler parameters (Graff / Reactor) remain on CPU while model is on GPU; forward() mixes devices when CUDA is available → runtime error.\n\nBecause of these issues the code cannot execute the specified commands successfully and therefore is not production-ready."
